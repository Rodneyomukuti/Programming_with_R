# Programming_with_R
Notes on Introduction and fundamentals of R

## 1.0 Introduction
R is a programming tool/language that is widely used by statisticians, data scientists and other users. It is widely used in computational genomics because it provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis classification, clustering, etc) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.

This tutorial will focus on two fundamental aspects of R.
i. Basic statistics
ii. Genomic analysis

### 1.1 Installing R and R studio
R is the *backbone* statistical language that uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) called R studio. For one to use R, they must have R studio installed

### R
For efficiency, you need to install the latest versions of R (4.0.3 and above). R is a free access software that can be downloaded [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

### R studio
You can download and install R studio using this [link](http://www.rstudio.com/). Upon installation, you can start using R by opening/starting R studio which gives you an interactive medium called the console. You can access the [documentation](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/categories/200035113-Documentation) on the layout of R studio
